# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately by opening a security advisory in GitHub (preferred) or contacting the maintainers directly.

Include:

- Description of the issue and potential impact
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
- Affected versions and environment details

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.
